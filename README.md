I used the code provided with the [book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html) with small modifications to work with pyhon3.12

---
- First run with 30 layers, batch size = 10, and learning rate = 3.0

  It reached a precision of 95.08 at the best epoch.

- Second run with higher number of layers, 35, and learning rate = 3.5
  
  The highest accuracy achived was 95.12
